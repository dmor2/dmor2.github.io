  	      @micro_cabbage @LeoDruat @IranDefense @lukp3000 @UAWeapons That's the approach they went with for Starstreak. Aerodynamics probably drove the choice to go for three darts as much as anything else. It's a compromise, of course, but so is everything else in engineering. And it's a 1980s design. 3/3

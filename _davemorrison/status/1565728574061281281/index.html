  	      @FouIvan @CovertShores From this viewpoint, the final casing appears to land extremely close to the bow. We don't have a second viewpoint to gauge separation in the other plane, but given that the grid fins are fixed, the risk seems remarkably high. How to explain this design choice? <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1565726885107073025-FbqRfKXXgAA4Hvd.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1565726885107073025-FbqRfKXXgAA4Hvd.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

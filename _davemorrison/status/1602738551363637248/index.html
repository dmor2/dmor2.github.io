  	      Speculate that this is footage of a Russian Su-30SM conducting a beyond visual range air-to-air engagement. This was found in a short Russian MoD clip about Su-35S operations.  I'm curious as to whether the audio provides any additional context. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><video controls src="../../tweets_media/1601205066748162049-9SQo_i3k_17U4dez.mp4?tag=12"></video></li></ul></div>

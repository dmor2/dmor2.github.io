  	      @FouIvan @CovertShores The design choice I'm curious about is: Why would the submarine-launched variant be designed to be capable of VLS launch when the resulting design appears to have an obvious, significant debris hazard issue? 2/5

  	      @FouIvan @CovertShores The only plausible explanation I can imagine is that it was developed as a secondary capability of the submarine-launched anti-submarine variant, which would not have the same debris hazard issue due to the steerable grid fins. 3/5

  	      @FouIvan @CovertShores As should already be apparent, all of my previous posts are low-quality, wild speculation.. but at this point I'm just not sure a truly sensible explanation exists. We've seen MiG-29s firing HARMs since, and this footage still seems weirder. 5/5

  	      Speculation: The two dramatic flashes seen prior to the crash in the Su-34 Yeysk incident may be the sequential ejection of the large canopy panels above the pilots, prior to the ejection of the pilots themselves. Here I've synchronised footage with a previous Su-34 ejection. 1/2 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><video controls src="../../tweets_media/1582308433394425857-6v4-rnS4OZoKiCjE.mp4?tag=12"></video></li></ul></div>

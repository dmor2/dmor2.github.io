  	      A recent Ka-52 shootdown was notable for two reasons: firstly, it was recorded simultaneously by two aerial sources, and secondly there appeared to be use of the ejection system, as a brief rocket burn followed by parachute deployment was observed in both sets of footage. 1/3 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><video controls src="../../tweets_media/1576891537190842369-2USsxKylcbtVe6Gv.mp4?tag=12"></video></li></ul></div>

  	      My own low-quality analysis: From the Bayraktar infrared footage, the missile detonation can be seen, followed by the Ka-52's immediate descent and ground impact. It appears that ejection occurs after impact. 2/3 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><video controls src="../../tweets_media/1576891567612186624-W6JRBVUYOkYJGql4.mp4?tag=12"></video></li></ul></div>

  	      The other footage also shows the wreckage, including what appears to be the rotor hub with (a few metres of) rotors still attached. As explosive rotor separation should occur early in the ejection sequence, this may suggest that the ejection occurred out of sequence. 3/3 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1576891579943747584-FeI4PxkXwAYyz9j.png"><img src="../../tweets_media/1576891579943747584-FeI4PxkXwAYyz9j.png"></a></li></ul></div>

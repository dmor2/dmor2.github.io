  	      Officially, RF-95143 was returning from a successful mission. Photographs suggest it was heading south west - toward the front line - when it crashed, approx 1 min from the probable firing point. If so, it would have crossed a 100m high ridge moments before it crashed. 1/6 <a href="https://twitter.com/_davemorrison/status/1628792182147629057">https://twitter.com/_davemorrison/status/1628792182147629057</a> <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1629524414936018944-Fp0lmK9WcAM3Nhu.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1629524414936018944-Fp0lmK9WcAM3Nhu.jpg"></a></li><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1629524414936018944-Fp0lm7SWAAA0jy1.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1629524414936018944-Fp0lm7SWAAA0jy1.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      There's no evidence that the ridge was approached at low level, but assuming it was, there's potential for increased loads on the airframe. Possible factors include manoeuvres to maintain low altitude, and instantaneous gusts resulting from wind gradients. 2/6

  	      RF-95143 had been flying low-level, high-speed missions over the last year. I don't have the knowledge to say whether the cumulative effect of this could significantly impact the ability of the airframe to withstand such loads. 4/6 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1629524422905282564-Fp0qdEgXgAA5jjf.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1629524422905282564-Fp0qdEgXgAA5jjf.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      TASS provides the Russian MoD statement that 'According to preliminary data, a technical fault is a likely cause of the crash'. That's a vague statement but does not seem to exclude structural failure. 5/6 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1629524425442770946-Fp0vxjOWcAA0obL.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1629524425442770946-Fp0vxjOWcAA0obL.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      A crude sim of a low level, 700kph approach to the ridge, with a loss of control at the top, ending at RF-95143's approximate crash site. Likely unrepresentative, but indicates how little decision time is available at low alt. RF-95143's pilot ejected but did not survive. 6/6 <div class="gallery"><ul><li><video controls src="../../tweets_media/1629524427678392321-tA7cOfFcjwQVQj2G.mp4?tag=12"></video></li></ul></div>
